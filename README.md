# SNHU-CS-330-REPO

This project has been a major undertaking for me as up to this point I had never done any work in the field of graphics. It was a long road to get to the final project, but by the end I had developed many new skills. Obviously I feel that everything pertaining to graphics (e.g. modeling, shaders, texturing, lighting) took a big step and I am proud of that growth, but I am really proud of the steps I took in learning how to integrate libraries written by others into my own work. This will be majorly important in my future work as building upon what others have done before us is a cornerstone of computer science. When developing this project, I had to take it one step at a time thanks to my lack of knowledge (and believe me they were small steps). Building iteratively on my previous work was often very helpful, but there were a couple instances in which the work I had done had limited what the program was capable of and had to be scrapped. These moments were all milestone moments in the development process though and each hurdle enabled me to carefully refine my work in a way that met my expectations. The entire development cycle of this project served as one giant learning experience in how to recycle code and optimize it to fit new goals and that is something that I will carry on into my future work.
